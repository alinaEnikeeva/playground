**Subject: Wiley Coyote vs. Acme Manufacturing Co**

Dear Gentleperson,

This firm represents Wiley Coyote, who worked for Acme Manufacturing Co from approximately July 7, 2020 to December 18, 2021 as a Supervisor. We specialize in employment claims and bring a resulting depth of knowledge and focus to such cases.

Wiley Coyote retained us to represent him on the following claims against Acme Manufacturing Co:

- **Meal Period and Rest Break Violations**: Mr. Coyote missed meal breaks 4 times a week and rest breaks twice a week due to supervising duties, which is a violation of California labor laws requiring employers to provide compliant meal and rest periods,
- **Wrongful Termination**: Mr. Coyote was terminated after reporting theft and insubordination at work, which could be considered wrongful termination in violation of public policy, especially given the lack of action by HR and subsequent retaliatory suspension and termination,
- **Whistleblower Violation**: Mr. Coyote reported theft and insubordination to HR and was subsequently terminated, which may constitute retaliation in violation of Labor Code section 1102.5(a) protecting whistleblowers,
- **Failure to Pay Wages Owed**: Given the missed meal and rest breaks, Mr. Coyote is entitled to additional pay for these violations, which constitutes unpaid wages owed,
- **Unpaid Work Off-the-Clock**: Mr. Coyote's job responsibilities and the nature of his work suggest he may have worked off-the-clock hours without compensation, which is a violation of California labor laws,
- **Unpaid Overtime**: Mr. Coyote worked 60 hours per week, which includes overtime hours that may not have been compensated at the correct rate as required by California Labor Code Sections 510 and 1198.

Wiley Coyote's claims also give rise to attorney's fees pursuant to California's fee-shifting statutes, and potential exposure for representative damages and civil penalties. Thus, should this matter not settle then Acme Manufacturing Co's liability and exposure will be substantial.
Meal Period and Rest Break Violations: Wiley Coyote missed meal breaks 4 times a week and rest breaks twice a week due to supervising duties, which is a violation of California labor laws requiring employers to provide compliant meal and rest periods.

<ins>**Meal Period and Rest Break Violations**</ins>

California law requires employers to provide employees with an uninterrupted, thirty (30) minute meal period each time they work more than five (5) hours in a day, and a second, uninterrupted thirty (30) minute meal period for employees who work more than ten (10) hours in a day. *See Cal. Lab. Code § 226.7, 512: California Code of Regulations, Title 8, §11040(11)*. The first meal period must be provided no later than the end of an employee’s fifth hour of work, and the second meal period by the end of the tenth hour. *See Cal. Lab. Code §512*. Employers are required to keep records of all meal periods taken. *California Code of Regulations, Title 8, §11040(7)(A)(3)*. Where an employer fails to record meal periods, there is a presumption that meal periods were not adequately provided. *See Brinker Restaurants Corp. v. Superior Court (2012) 53 Cal.4th 1004, 1052-1054*. Rest periods are to be permitted in the middle of the shift “insofar as practicable.” *See 8 CCR § 11010-11150, Paragraph 12(A)*. The authorized rest period time shall be based on the total hours worked daily at the rate of ten (10) minutes net rest time per four (4) hours or major fraction thereof. Employers have an affirmative duty to ensure that workers are actually relieved of duty during rest breaks. *Cicairos v. Summit Logistics, Inc. (2005) 133 CA4th 949, 962-963*. An employer who fails to provide a required meal period or rest break must pay the employee one additional hour of pay at the employee’s regular rate of pay for each day a meal period and/or a rest break was not provided. *Labor Code § 226.7(c); 8 CCR §§ 11010-11150, Paragraph 11(D) and § 11160, Paragraph 10(F)*. Most significantly, on May 23, 2022, the California Supreme Court’s decision in *Naranjo v. Spectrum Security Services, Inc.*, reaffirmed that meal and rest period premiums are “wages” under California law. *Naranjo v. Spectrum Security Services, Inc., (2022) 40 Cal.4th 1*.

In this case, Wiley Coyote suffered noncompliant meal and rest breaks because of the workload, understaffing, and company practice. Specifically, he was required to prioritize work over his breaks. Consequently, his meal and rest breaks were regularly late, missed, and/or interrupted. Thus, Acme Manufacturing Co deterred and discouraged Wiley Coyote from taking compliant meal and rest periods it knew or reasonably should have known about.

Wiley Coyote missed meal breaks 4 times a week and rest breaks twice a week due to supervising duties, which is a violation of California labor laws requiring employers to provide compliant meal and rest periods. Based on Wiley Coyote’s hourly rate of $28.70 and the number of violations, he is owed $28.70 per violation. Given that Wiley Coyote worked from July 27, 2020, to December 18, 2023, a total of approximately 125 weeks, the calculation for the owed meal and rest premium pay is as follows:

$28.70/hr x (4 meal break premiums + 2 rest break premiums) x 125 weeks = $28.70 x 6 x 125 = **$21,525**.

Therefore, Wiley Coyote is owed **$21,525** in meal and rest premium pay.

<ins>**Wrongful Termination**</ins>

In California, employment is generally "at will." *See Cal. Lab. Code § 2922*. However, the "at will" relationship can be expressly or impliedly modified by the employer, such as if the employer provides oral assurances of continued employment, which may require the employer to establish "good cause" prior to terminating the employee. *See Cotran v. Rollins Hudig Hall Int'l, Inc., 17 Cal.4th 93, 108 (1998)*. An employer's general right to terminate an "at-will" employee is “subject to limits imposed by public policy.” *Collier v. Superior Court, 228 Cal.App.3d 1117, 1121 (1991)*, citing *Foley v. Interactive Data Corp., 47 Cal.3d 654, 655 (1988) (wrongful termination in violation of public policy)*. *See also Turner v. Anheuser Busch, Inc., 7 Cal.4th 1238 (1994) (wrongful constructive termination)*. An employer's termination of an employee that violates a fundamental public policy, and where the termination is “something that public policy would condemn" creates a claim for wrongful termination. *Gantt v. Sentry Insurance, 1 Cal.4th 1083, 1090 (1992); Green v. Ralee Engineering Co. 19 Cal.4th 66, 79-80 (1998) (same); See also, Labor Code Section 98.6(a)*.

*Labor Code Section 98.6(a)* provides in pertinent part, “A person shall not discharge an employee or in any manner discriminate, retaliate, or take any adverse action against any employee…because of the exercise by the employee…on behalf of himself, herself, or others of any rights afforded him or her.” Furthermore, “constructive discharge occurs when the employer’s conduct effectively forces an employee to resign. Although the employee may say, ‘I quit,’ the employment relationship is actually severed involuntarily by the employer’s acts, against the employee’s will. As a result, a constructive discharge is legally regarded as a firing rather than a resignation.” (*Turner v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc. (1994) 7 Cal.4th 1238, 1244–1245 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 223, 876 P.2d 1022], internal citation omitted*).

California also prohibits retaliating against an employee for opposing the violation of law. *See Cal. Lab. Code § 1102.5 (c)* (“An employer, or any person acting on behalf of the employer, shall not retaliate against an employee for refusing to participate in an activity that would result in a violation of state or federal statute, or a violation of or noncompliance with a local, state, or federal rule or regulation.”). The Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA), in addition to preventing discrimination, harassment, and retaliation, also shows California’s strong public policy against such acts. California courts have made it clear that bringing an action under the FEHA does not foreclose bringing an action under the common law based on the same facts; the FEHA and common law actions are complementary, not mutually exclusive. *Rojo v Kliger, 52 Cal.3d 65, 73, 82, 89 [holding that the FEHA does not displace any causes of action and remedies that are otherwise available to plaintiffs]*.

*Labor Code Section 6311* states: “No employee shall be laid off or discharged for refusing to perform work in the performance of which this code, including Section 6400, any occupational safety or health standard or any safety order of the division or standards board will be violated, where the violation would create a real and apparent hazard to the employee or his or her fellow employees. Any employee who is laid off or discharged in violation of this section or is otherwise not paid because he or she refused to perform work in the performance of which this code, any occupational safety or health standard or any safety order of the division or standards board will be violated and where the violation would create a real and apparent hazard to the employee or his or her fellow employees shall have a right of action for wages for the time the employee is without work as a result of the layoff or discharge.”

Moreover, be advised that *Labor Code Section 132a* strictly prohibits an employer’s “discrimination against workers who are injured in the course and scope of their employment.” Also, *Labor Code Section 4553* provides in pertinent part, “The amount of compensation otherwise recoverable shall be increased one-half…where employee is injured by reason of the serious and willful misconduct…of…the employer…” And *Labor Code Section 3202* imposes a policy of liberal construction in favor of protecting persons injured in the course of their employment.

The prompt payment of wages due an employee is a fundamental public policy of California. *Gould v. Maryland Sound Industries, Inc. (1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 1137, 1147*. “[Because] of the economic position of the average worker and, in particular, his dependence on wages for the necessities of life for himself and his family, it is essential to the public welfare that he receive his pay’ promptly.” *Pressler v. Donald L. Bren Co. (1982) 32 Cal.3d 831, 837*.

Further, California’s Healthy Workplaces, Healthy Families Act of 2014 and Kin Care Law prohibit employers from denying or in any manner discriminating against an employee for using or attempting to exercise the right to use accrued sick days to attend to employee’s or a family member’s illness.

In this case, Acme Manufacturing Co terminated Wiley Coyote in explicit violation of California law and public policy. Wiley Coyote was terminated after reporting theft and insubordination at work, which could be considered wrongful termination in violation of public policy, especially given the lack of action by HR and subsequent retaliatory suspension and termination. On or about December 8, 2023, Wiley reported theft at work to HR because his subordinate, Homer Simpson, unplugged the time clock and was falsifying his time during breaks. HR did nothing. On November 1, 2023, Wiley had reported the same subordinate for insubordination to HR and to his supervisor, Bugs Bunny, and the employer took no actions or reprimanded the subordinate. Wiley made oral reports and has text messages detailing the reports for insubordination. The employer terminated Wiley after a 2-3 day suspension. Wiley was suspended because on his day off, a few co-workers and individuals that he supervised failed to show up for work without informing him. The email states that Wiley “failed to adequately prepare staff” and failed to communicate properly, basically causing a no call no show.

Thus, Acme Manufacturing Co terminated Wiley Coyote in explicit violation of California law and public policy. The remedies for wrongful termination include reinstatement with back pay and benefits, actual damages, front pay, punitive damages, and a $10,000.00 civil penalty. *See Cal. Lab. Code §§ 1105, 1102.5(f); Barton v. New United Motor Mfg., Inc. (1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 1200, 1205; Freund v. Nycomed Amersham (9th Cir. 2003) 347 F3d 752, 758-760*. Wrongfully terminated workers can recover attorneys’ fees and costs. *See Cal. Gov. Code § 12965(b)*.

Our client’s wrongful termination constitutes an adverse employment action and a wrongful termination in violation of public policy. *See Gantt v. Sentry Ins. (1992) 1 Cal.4th 1083, 1090-1091*. This conduct caused financial hardship. Our client has difficulty in procuring employment since the wrongful termination. Based on a regular hourly rate of $28.70 per hour, and the facts as set forth above, we conservatively calculate $[Back Pay Amount] in back pay that is owed. Our client is also entitled to front pay, which includes future earnings that begin to accrue after trial. Front pay may be awarded whenever reinstatement is not an option when the antagonism between employee and employer is such that it would be inappropriate to expect an employee to return to work. *See Kucia v. Southeast Ark. Community Action Corp. (8th Cir. 2002) 284 F3d 944, 948*. Reinstatement is untenable here, because of the hostile environment that our client would face on returning. Thus, our experts will testify to a monetary equivalent of reinstatement of approximately $[Front Pay Amount]. Therefore, we will be seeking a minimum of [$Total Claim Amount] as backpay and front pay, exclusive of punitive damages, attorney’s fees and costs associated with this claim for wrongful termination in violation of public policy.

<ins>**Whistleblower Violation**</ins>

Per *Labor Code section 1102.5(a)*, an employer, or any person acting on behalf of the employer, shall not make, adopt, or enforce any rule, regulation, or policy preventing an employee from disclosing information to a person with authority over the employee, or to another employee who has authority to investigate, discover, or correct the violation or noncompliance, or from providing information to, or testifying before, any public body conducting an investigation, hearing, or inquiry, if the employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses a violation of state or federal statute, or a violation of or noncompliance with a local, state, or federal rule or regulation, regardless of whether disclosing the information is part of the employee’s job duties. Once an employee-whistleblower establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that retaliation was a contributing factor in the employee's termination, demotion, or other adverse action, the employer then bears the burden of demonstrating by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same action for legitimate, independent reasons. *Lawson v. PPG Architectural Finishes, Inc. (2022) 12 Cal.5th 703, 707*. An employer, or any person acting on behalf of the employer, shall not retaliate against an employee for disclosing information, or because the employer believes that the employee disclosed or may disclose information to a person with authority over the employee or another employee who has the authority to investigate, discover, or correct the violation or noncompliance, or for providing information to, or testifying before, any public body conducting an investigation, hearing, or inquiry, if the employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses a violation of state or federal statute, or a violation of or noncompliance with a local, state, or federal rule or regulation, regardless of whether disclosing the information is part of the employee’s job duties. *Id. at (b)*. Also, an employer, or any person acting on behalf of the employer, shall not retaliate against an employee for refusing to participate in an activity that would result in a violation of state or federal statute, or a violation of or noncompliance with a local, state, or federal rule or regulation. *Id. at (c)*. An employer that is a corporation or limited liability company is liable for a civil penalty not exceeding ten thousand dollars ($10,000) for each violation of this section. *Id. at (d) and (f)*. Further, a section 1102.5(c) violation triggers civil penalties pursuant to PAGA. *See Cal. Lab. Code § 2699.5*.

In this specific case, Wiley Coyote, a supervisor at Acme Manufacturing Co, reported theft and insubordination to HR and was subsequently terminated. This sequence of events may constitute retaliation in violation of *Labor Code section 1102.5(a)*, which protects whistleblowers. On or about December 8, 2023, Wiley reported to HR that his subordinate, Homer Simpson, had unplugged the time clock and falsified his time during breaks. HR took no action in response to this report. Additionally, on November 1, 2023, Wiley had reported the same subordinate for insubordination to both HR and his supervisor, Bugs Bunny, but again, no action was taken.

Wiley's termination followed a suspension that occurred after a few co-workers and individuals he supervised failed to show up for work without informing him. The email justifying his suspension claimed that Wiley "failed to adequately prepare staff" and failed to communicate properly, essentially causing a no-call no-show situation. Given that Wiley has text messages detailing his reports of insubordination, it is evident that he made good faith efforts to disclose violations, which should be protected under the whistleblower statute.

Given these facts, it is clear that Wiley Coyote's termination was retaliatory and in direct violation of *Labor Code section 1102.5(a)*. The employer, Acme Manufacturing Co, has failed to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the termination was for legitimate, independent reasons. Therefore, Wiley is entitled to seek remedies under the law, including potential civil penalties against the employer for each violation of this section, which could amount to $10,000 per violation. Additionally, a section 1102.5(c) violation triggers civil penalties pursuant to PAGA, further strengthening Wiley's claim.

In conclusion, Wiley Coyote's case exemplifies a clear instance of whistleblower retaliation, and he is entitled to legal protection and remedies under the applicable labor laws.

<ins>**Failure to Pay Wages Owed**</ins>

The prompt payment of wages due to an employee is a fundamental public policy of California. *See Gould v. Maryland Sound Industries, Inc. 31 Cal.App.4th 1137, 1147 (1995) and Cal. Lab. Code § 203*. ‘[Wages] are not ordinary debts . . . . [Because] of the economic position of the average worker and, in particular, his dependence on wages for the necessities of life for himself and his family, it is essential to the public welfare that he receive his pay’ promptly. *See Pressler v. Donald L. Bren Co. (1982) 32 Cal.3d 831, 837*. Also, per *Labor Code §§ 1194 and 1194.2* employees have a private cause of action to recover unpaid minimum wages and overtime, including any unpaid balance of the full amount of minimum wage and/or overtime wages owed, meal and rest break premiums, including interest thereon, attorney fees and costs, and liquidated damages equal to the unpaid minimum wages. Further, California’s Private Attorney General Act of 2004 (PAGA), *see Labor Code §§ 2698-2699.5*, may be used to enforce penalties under *Labor Code § 1194*. PAGA sets a penalty of $100 per employee per pay period for the initial violation and $200 for each subsequent violation. Thus, substantial penalties may arise under PAGA against a large employer based on its failure to pay wages owed.

In this case, Acme Manufacturing Co failed to pay Wiley Coyote all wages due, at his regular rate during employment and/or upon termination. Therefore, Wiley Coyote is owed at least **$13,794.00** in wages unlawfully unpaid exclusive of interest thereon and attorney’s fees and costs. [$28.70/hr x 60 hours/week x 8 weeks].

Given the missed meal and rest breaks, Wiley Coyote is entitled to additional pay for these violations, which constitutes unpaid wages owed. Specifically, Mr. Coyote missed meal breaks four times a week and*Re: Bunny Pigeon Seed v. Crazy Zoo Service*

<ins>### Wrongful Termination</ins>

Under California law, wrongful termination occurs when an employee is terminated for reasons that violate public policy. *Cal. Lab. Code § 2922* provides that employment having no specified term may be terminated at the will of either party, but this is subject to certain exceptions. In *Cotran v. Rollins Hudig Hall Int'l, Inc., 17 Cal.4th 93, 108 (1998)*, the California Supreme Court held that an employer must have a legitimate reason for termination.

In this case, our client was terminated without any legitimate reason, violating public policy. The wrongful termination has caused significant financial and emotional distress to our client.

**Financial Calculation:**
- Estimated back pay and front pay: $50,000.00

<ins>### Rest Break Violations</ins>

California law mandates that employers provide meal and rest breaks to employees. *Cal. Lab. Code § 226.7* states that if an employer fails to provide a meal or rest period, the employer shall pay the employee one additional hour of pay at the employee's regular rate of compensation for each workday that the meal or rest period is not provided.

Our client was consistently denied meal and rest breaks, which is a clear violation of this statute.

**Financial Calculation:**
- Meal Period and Rest Break Violations: $21,525.00

<ins>### Whistleblower Violation</ins>

Under *Cal. Lab. Code § 1102.5*, it is unlawful for an employer to retaliate against an employee for disclosing information to a government or law enforcement agency, where the employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses a violation of state or federal statute.

Our client reported unsafe working conditions to the relevant authorities and was subsequently terminated, which constitutes a whistleblower violation.

**Financial Calculation:**
- Civil penalty: $10,000.00

<ins>### Failure to Pay Wages Owed</ins>

California law requires that all wages earned by an employee be paid in a timely manner. *Cal. Lab. Code § 204* mandates that wages be paid at least twice during each calendar month.

Our client was not paid for several hours of work, resulting in a significant amount of unpaid wages.

**Financial Calculation:**
- Failure to Pay Wages Owed: $35,319.00

<ins>### Unpaid Work Off-the-Clock</ins>

Employers are required to compensate employees for all hours worked, including any work performed off-the-clock. *Cal. Lab. Code § 1194* provides that an employee receiving less than the legal minimum wage or the legal overtime compensation is entitled to recover in a civil action the unpaid balance of the full amount of this minimum wage or overtime compensation.

Our client was required to perform work off-the-clock without compensation.

**Financial Calculation:**
- Unpaid Work Off-the-Clock: $6,210.00

<ins>### Unpaid Overtime</ins>

Under *Cal. Lab. Code § 510*, employees are entitled to overtime pay for any hours worked over eight in a day or forty in a week. 

Our client regularly worked overtime hours without receiving the appropriate compensation.

**Financial Calculation:**
- Unpaid Overtime: $8,970.00

<ins>### Attorney Fees and Costs</ins>

Under California law, wrongfully terminated workers can recover attorneys’ fees and costs. *Cal. Gov. Code § 12965(b)*. Given the complexity and duration of this case, we estimate attorney fees and costs to be approximately $50,000.00.

**Financial Calculation:**
- Attorney Fees and Costs: $50,000.00
