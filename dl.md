### Detailed Explanation of Claims

**_Wrongful Termination_**

In California, employment is generally "at will." *See Cal. Lab. Code § 2922*. However, the "at will" relationship can be expressly or impliedly modified by the employer, such as if the employer provides oral assurances of continued employment, which may require the employer to establish "good cause" prior to terminating the employee. *See Cotran v. Rollins Hudig Hall Int'l, Inc., 17 Cal.4th 93, 108 (1998)*. An employer's general right to terminate an "at-will" employee is “subject to limits imposed by public policy.” *Collier v. Superior Court, 228 Cal.App.3d 1117, 1121 (1991)*, citing *Foley v. Interactive Data Corp., 47 Cal.3d 654, 655 (1988) (wrongful termination in violation of public policy)*. See also *Turner v. Anheuser Busch, Inc., 7 Cal.4th 1238 (1994) (wrongful constructive termination)*.

An employer's termination of an employee that violates a fundamental public policy, and where the termination is “something that public policy would condemn" creates a claim for wrongful termination. *Gantt v. Sentry Insurance, 1 Cal.4th 1083, 1090 (1992); Green v. Ralee Engineering Co. 19 Cal.4th 66, 79-80 (1998) (same); See also, Labor Code Section 98.6(a)*.

Also, *Labor Code Section 98.6(a)* provides in pertinent part, “A person shall not discharge an employee or in any manner discriminate, retaliate, or take any adverse action against any employee…because of the exercise by the employee…on behalf of himself, herself, or others of any rights afforded him or her.”

Furthermore, “constructive discharge occurs when the employer’s conduct effectively forces an employee to resign. Although the employee may say, ‘I quit,’ the employment relationship is actually severed involuntarily by the employer’s acts, against the employee’s will. As a result, a constructive discharge is legally regarded as a firing rather than a resignation.” *(Turner v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc. (1994) 7 Cal.4th 1238, 1244–1245 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 223, 876 P.2d 1022], internal citation omitted.)*.

California also prohibits retaliating against an employee for opposing the violation of law. *See Cal. Lab. Code § 1102.5 (c)* (“An employer, or any person acting on behalf of the employer, shall not retaliate against an employee for refusing to participate in an activity that would result in a violation of state or federal statute, or a violation of or noncompliance with a local, state, or federal rule or regulation.”).

In the case of Bunny Pigeon Seed, the client was terminated shortly after being involved in a workplace accident on January 18, 2023, while performing her duties as a Recovery Agent for Crazy Zoo Service. The accident occurred around 11:30 p.m. when Bunny was hit by a car doing donuts in the intersection. Following the accident, Bunny reported the incident to her supervisor, Foxy Wolf, who instructed her to go to the hospital. Bunny was taken by ambulance and remained in the hospital from midnight to 5 a.m. During this time, Foxy Wolf contacted Bunny's wife, Mouse Seed, to check on Bunny's condition and to fill out an accident report.

Bunny was released from the hospital with a medical note taking her off work for three days. While Bunny was waiting for the worker's compensation paperwork, which she received on January 27, 2023, she was terminated by Crazy Zoo Service on January 28, 2023. Bunny called Foxy Wolf to inform him that she was ready to return to work, but she was told that she had been terminated. The termination document stated that Bunny was terminated on the day of the accident.

This termination appears to be in violation of California's public policy, as it occurred shortly after Bunny exercised her right to seek medical attention and worker's compensation following a workplace injury. The timing of the termination suggests that it may have been retaliatory in nature, which is prohibited under *Labor Code Section 98.6(a)* and *Cal. Lab. Code § 1102.5 (c)*. Additionally, the termination may have violated the implied modification of the "at-will" employment relationship, as Bunny had oral assurances of continued employment and was terminated without good cause.

Given these circumstances, Bunny Pigeon Seed has a strong claim for wrongful termination against Crazy Zoo Service. The termination not only violates fundamental public policy but also appears to be retaliatory in nature, which is condemned by public policy and California labor laws.

**_FEHA_**

The Fair Employment and Housing Act, in addition to preventing discrimination, harassment, and retaliation, also shows California’s strong public policy against such acts. California courts have made it clear that bringing an action under the FEHA does not foreclose bringing an action under the common law based on the same facts; the FEHA and common law actions are complementary, not mutually exclusive. *Rojo v Kliger, 52 Cal.3d 65, 73, 82, 89 [holding that the FEHA does not displace any causes of action and remedies that are otherwise available to plaintiffs]*.

In the case of Bunny Pigeon Seed, there is substantial evidence to suggest that her termination from Crazy Zoo Service may have been due to disability discrimination, a violation of the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA). On January 18, 2023, Bunny was involved in a vehicle accident while performing her duties as a Recovery Agent. Following the accident, she was taken to the hospital and received a medical note excusing her from work for three days. Despite this, Bunny was terminated on January 28, 2023, just one day after receiving worker's compensation paperwork.

The timing and circumstances of Bunny's termination strongly indicate that Crazy Zoo Service may have discriminated against her due to her disability or perceived disability resulting from the workplace accident. This is a clear violation of FEHA, which prohibits employers from discriminating against employees based on their physical or mental disabilities. Furthermore, the company's failure to accommodate Bunny's temporary disability by allowing her the necessary time to recover further supports this claim.

Additionally, Bunny's supervisor, Foxy Wolf, was aware of her condition and the need for medical leave, as evidenced by his communication with Bunny's wife during her hospital stay. Despite this knowledge, the company proceeded with her termination, which could be seen as retaliatory and discriminatory under FEHA.

Given these facts, Bunny Pigeon Seed has a strong case for a FEHA claim against Crazy Zoo Service. The company's actions not only violate FEHA but also go against California's public policy of protecting employees from discrimination and retaliation based on disability. Bunny is entitled to pursue both FEHA and common law actions to seek justice and appropriate remedies for the wrongful termination and discrimination she experienced.

**_On-the-Job Injury_**

Moreover, be advised that *Labor Code Section 132a* strictly prohibits an employer’s “discrimination against workers who are injured in the course and scope of their employment.” Also, *Labor Code Section 4553* provides in pertinent part, “The amount of compensation otherwise recoverable shall be increased one-half…where employee is injured by reason of the serious and willful misconduct…of…the employer…” And *Labor Code Section 3202* imposes a policy of liberal construction in favor of protecting persons injured in the course of their employment.

**Explanation**

The client, Bunny Pigeon Seed, was involved in a vehicle accident while on duty as a Recovery Agent for Crazy Zoo Service. This accident occurred on January 18, 2023, at approximately 11:30 p.m. while Bunny was performing her job responsibilities, which include recovering assets and repossessing vehicles. Bunny was hit by a car doing donuts in the intersection while driving a company car. The company has cameras in the vehicle that captured the incident.

Upon reporting the accident to her supervisor, Foxy Wolf, Bunny was instructed to go to the hospital. She was taken by ambulance and remained in the hospital from midnight to 5 a.m. Foxy Wolf contacted Bunny's wife, Mouse Seed, to inquire about Bunny's condition and to ensure an accident report was filled out. Bunny was released from the hospital with a medical note taking her off work for three days.

During this period, Bunny was waiting for the worker's compensation paperwork, which she received on January 27. However, on January 28, Bunny was informed by Foxy Wolf that she was terminated. The termination document indicated that her employment was terminated on the day of the accident, January 18, 2023. This termination occurred despite Bunny's readiness to return to work and her compliance with all necessary procedures following the accident.

Given these circumstances, Bunny's termination appears to be a violation of *Labor Code Section 132a*, which prohibits discrimination against workers injured during their employment. Additionally, the serious and willful misconduct of the employer in terminating Bunny under these conditions may warrant an increase in compensation as per *Labor Code Section 4553*. Furthermore, *Labor Code Section 3202* supports a liberal interpretation in favor of protecting injured workers, which strengthens Bunny's claim.

In summary, Bunny Pigeon Seed's on-the-job injury and subsequent termination by Crazy Zoo Service present a strong case for violation of multiple labor codes designed to protect injured workers. The legal justifications provided by these labor codes support Bunny's claim for increased compensation and protection against discriminatory termination practices.

**_Unpaid Wages Complaint_**

The prompt payment of wages due an employee is a fundamental public policy of California. *Gould v. Maryland Sound Industries, Inc. (1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 1137, 1147*. “Because of the economic position of the average worker and, in particular, his dependence on wages for the necessities of life for himself and his family, it is essential to the public welfare that he receive his pay promptly.” *Pressler v. Donald L. Bren Co. (1982) 32 Cal.3d 831, 837*.

In the case of Bunny Pigeon Seed, an employee of Crazy Zoo Service, there is a clear indication of unpaid wages. Bunny Pigeon Seed was employed as a Recovery Agent from April 18, 2022, to January 18, 2023. During this period, she was paid an hourly rate of $18.00 and worked a usual weekly schedule of 9 PM to 5 AM, Monday through Friday.

According to the client data and matter analysis, Bunny Pigeon Seed reported not knowing if overtime was paid and mentioned 8 hours of unpaid wages. This raises concerns about potential unpaid wages, which is a violation of California's labor laws. The client’s final paycheck was received, but it did not include payment for 8 hours of work.

Given the hourly rate of $18.00, the calculation for the unpaid wages is as follows:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times \$18.00/\text{hour} = \$144.00 \]
Therefore, Bunny Pigeon Seed is owed $144.00 in unpaid wages. This amount is critical for her, considering her dependence on wages for the necessities of life for herself and her family, as emphasized in the *Pressler* case.

Furthermore, the matter analysis indicates that Bunny Pigeon Seed did not receive rest breaks, which is another violation of California labor laws. The violations occurred 5 times per week, and given the duration of her employment, this adds up to a significant number of missed rest breaks. However, the primary focus of this claim is the unpaid wages.

In conclusion, Crazy Zoo Service has failed to comply with the fundamental public policy of California regarding the prompt payment of wages. Bunny Pigeon Seed is entitled to $144.00 in unpaid wages, and this demand seeks immediate payment of the owed amount to rectify the situation.

**_Failure to Pay Wages Owed_**

The prompt payment of wages due to an employee is a fundamental public policy of California. *See Gould v. Maryland Sound Industries, Inc. 31 Cal.App.4th 1137,1147 (1995) and Cal. Lab. Code § 203*. ‘[Wages] are not ordinary debts . . . . [Because] of the economic position of the average worker and, in particular, his dependence on wages for the necessities of life for himself and his family, it is essential to the public welfare that he receive his pay’ promptly. *See Pressler v. Donald L. Bren Co. (1982) 32 Cal.3d 831, 837*.

Also, per *Labor Code §§ 1194 and 1194.2* employees have a private cause of action to recover unpaid minimum wages and overtime, including any unpaid balance of the full amount of minimum wage and/or overtime wages owed, meal and rest break premiums, including interest thereon, attorney fees and costs, and liquidated damages equal to the unpaid minimum wages.

Further, California’s Private Attorney General Act of 2004 (PAGA), *see Labor Code §§ 2698-2699.5*, may be used to enforce penalties under *Labor Code § 1194*. PAGA sets a penalty of $100 per employee per pay period for the initial violation and $200 for each subsequent violation. Thus, substantial penalties may arise under PAGA against a large employer based on its failure to pay wages owed.

In this case, Crazy Zoo Service failed to pay Bunny Pigeon Seed all wages due, at her regular rate during employment and/or upon termination. Bunny Pigeon Seed was employed as a Recovery Agent from April 18, 2022, to January 18, 2023, with a regular hourly rate of $18.00. During her employment, she was not paid for 8 hours of work, amounting to $144.00 in unpaid wages ([$18.00/hr x 8 hours]).

Therefore, Bunny Pigeon Seed is owed at least $144.00 in wages unlawfully unpaid exclusive of interest thereon and attorney’s fees and costs. This failure to pay wages promptly is a clear violation of California labor laws, and Bunny Pigeon Seed is entitled to recover these unpaid wages along with any applicable penalties under PAGA.

**_Unreimbursed Business Expenses_**

California Labor Code section 2802 requires that:
An employer shall indemnify his or her employee for all necessary expenditures and losses incurred by the employee in direct consequence of the discharge of his or her duties. Necessary expenditures or losses include all reasonable costs, including but not limited to, attorney’s fees incurred by the employee enforcing the rights granted by this section.

Bunny Pigeon Seed incurred expenses in direct consequence of the discharge of her duties as a Recovery Agent at Crazy Zoo Service. Specifically, she was required to use her personal vehicle to drive approximately 200 miles per week for work purposes. According to the IRS mileage rate of $0.58 per mile, this amounts to $116.00 per week in vehicle expenses. Over the course of her employment from April 18, 2022, to January 18, 2023, which is approximately 39 weeks, this totals $4,524.00 in vehicle expenses.

Additionally, Bunny Pigeon Seed was required to use her $80.00 monthly personal cellphone service extensively for work purposes. We estimate that Crazy Zoo Service is responsible for compensating Bunny Pigeon Seed for 50% of the total cost of service, which amounts to $40.00 per month. Over the same 9-month period, this totals $360.00 in cellphone expenses.

Furthermore, Bunny Pigeon Seed was required to purchase straps, lights, and tools as necessary expenditures for her employment, which amounted to $800.00.

However, Crazy Zoo Service failed to reimburse her for these necessary expenditures. Therefore, Bunny Pigeon Seed is owed a total of $5,684.00 for unreimbursed business expenses, exclusive of attorney’s fees and costs. This total includes $4,524.00 for vehicle expenses, $360.00 for cellphone expenses, and $800.00 for the purchase of straps, lights, and tools.

In summary, Crazy Zoo Service is legally obligated under California Labor Code section 2802 to reimburse Bunny Pigeon Seed for these necessary business expenses incurred during her employment. Failure to do so has resulted in a significant financial burden on Bunny Pigeon Seed, for which she seeks full reimbursement.

**_Late Paycheck Violations_**

It has long been recognized that it is essential to the public welfare that employees receive their pay when it is due. *In re Trombley (1948) 31 Cal. 2d 801, 809*. *California Labor Code Section 204* also sets forth important public policy objectives underlying every employer’s wage payment timing obligations.

All wages, earned by any person in any employment are due and payable twice during each calendar month, on days designated in advance by the employer as the regular paydays. Labor performed between the 1st and 15th days, inclusive, of any calendar month shall be paid for between the 16th and the 26th day of the month during which the labor was performed, and labor performed between the 16th and the last day, inclusive, of any calendar month, shall be paid for between the 1st and 10th day of the following month.

Also, per *California Labor Code Section 210(a)* every person who fails to pay the wages of each employee as provided in Sections 204 shall be subject to a civil penalty as follows: (1) For any initial violation, one hundred dollars ($100) for each failure to pay each employee. (2) For each subsequent violation, or any willful or intentional violation, two hundred dollars ($200) for each failure to pay each employee, plus 25 percent of the amount unlawfully withheld.

Crazy Zoo Service paid Bunny Seed’s final paycheck 10 days late. Therefore, Bunny Seed is entitled to $660.00 in late paycheck violations. [($100.00 + ($200.00 x 1) + ($18.00/hr. x 40 hours/week x 2 weeks x 25% x 1)].

**Explanation**

In this specific case, Bunny Seed, who was employed as a Recovery Agent by Crazy Zoo Service, experienced a delay in receiving her final paycheck. According to the client data, Bunny Seed's employment ended on January 18, 2023, but her final paycheck was received 10 days late. This delay constitutes a violation of *California Labor Code Section 204*, which mandates timely payment of wages.

Based on the provided information, Bunny Seed's hourly rate was $18.00, and she typically worked 40 hours per week. Given the delay in payment, Bunny Seed is entitled to compensation for this violation. The calculation for the amount owed is as follows:
1. Initial violation penalty: $100.00
2. Subsequent violation penalty: $200.00 (assuming one pay period of delay)
3. Additional penalty: 25% of the amount unlawfully withheld
Calculating the total amount:
- Initial violation: $100.00
- Subsequent violation: $200.00 x 1 = $200.00
- Additional penalty: $18.00/hr x
