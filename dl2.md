**Subject: Wiley Coyote vs. Acme Manufacturing Co**

Dear Gentleperson,

This firm represents Wiley Coyote, who worked for Acme Manufacturing Co from approximately July 7, 2020 to December 18, 2021 as a Supervisor. We specialize in employment claims and bring a resulting depth of knowledge and focus to such cases.

Wiley Coyote retained us to represent him on the following claims against Acme Manufacturing Co:
- **Wrongful Termination**: Mr. Coyote was terminated after reporting theft and insubordination, which could be considered retaliation and wrongful termination in violation of public policy,
- **Meal Period and Rest Break Violations**: Mr. Coyote missed meal breaks 4 times a week and rest breaks twice a week due to supervising tasks, which is a violation of California labor laws,
- **Whistleblower Violation**: Mr. Coyote reported theft and insubordination, and subsequently faced termination, which could be seen as retaliation for whistleblowing.

*Wiley Coyote's claims also give rise to attorney's fees pursuant to California's fee-shifting statutes, and potential exposure for representative damages and civil penalties. Thus, should this matter not settle then Acme Manufacturing Co's liability and exposure will be substantial.*
```

<ins> **Wrongful Termination** </ins>

In California, employment is of course generally “at will.” *See Cal. Lab. Code § 2922*. However, the "at will" relationship can be expressly or impliedly modified by the employer, such as if the employer provides oral assurances of continued employment, which may require the employer to establish "good cause" prior to terminating the employee. *See Cotran v. Rollins Hudig Hall Int'l, Inc., 17 Cal.4th 93, 108 (1998)*. An employer's general right to terminate an "at-will" employee is “subject to limits imposed by public policy.” *Collier v. Superior Court, 228 Cal.App.3d 1117, 1121 (1991)*, citing *Foley v. Interactive Data Corp., 47 Cal.3d 654, 655 (1988) (wrongful termination in violation of public policy)*. See also *Turner v. Anheuser Busch, Inc., 7 Cal.4th 1238 (1994) (wrongful constructive termination)*. An employer's termination of an employee that violates a fundamental public policy, and where the termination is “something that public policy would condemn" creates a claim for wrongful termination. *Gantt v. Sentry Insurance, 1 Cal.4th 1083, 1090 (1992); Green v. Ralee Engineering Co. 19 Cal.4th 66, 79-80 (1998) (same); See also, Labor Code Section 98.6(a)*.

*Labor Code Section 98.6(a)* provides in pertinent part, “A person shall not discharge an employee or in any manner discriminate, retaliate, or take any adverse action against any employee…because of the exercise by the employee…on behalf of himself, herself, or others of any rights afforded him or her.” Furthermore, “constructive discharge occurs when the employer’s conduct effectively forces an employee to resign. Although the employee may say, ‘I quit,’ the employment relationship is actually severed involuntarily by the employer’s acts, against the employee’s will. As a result, a constructive discharge is legally regarded as a firing rather than a resignation.” (*Turner v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc. (1994) 7 Cal.4th 1238, 1244–1245 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 223, 876 P.2d 1022], internal citation omitted*).

California also prohibits retaliating against an employee for opposing the violation of law. *See Cal. Lab. Code § 1102.5 (c)* (“An employer, or any person acting on behalf of the employer, shall not retaliate against an employee for refusing to participate in an activity that would result in a violation of state or federal statute, or a violation of or noncompliance with a local, state, or federal rule or regulation.”).

The Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA), in addition to preventing discrimination, harassment and retaliation, also shows California’s strong public policy against such acts. California courts have made it clear that bringing an action under the FEHA does not foreclose bringing an action under the common law based on the same facts; the FEHA and common law actions are complementary, not mutually exclusive. *Rojo v Kliger, 52 Cal.3d 65, 73, 82, 89 [holding that the FEHA does not displace any causes of action and remedies that are otherwise available to plaintiffs]*.

*Labor Code Section 6311* states: “No employee shall be laid off or discharged for refusing to perform work in the performance of which this code, including Section 6400, any occupational safety or health standard or any safety order of the division or standards board will be violated, where the violation would create a real and apparent hazard to the employee or his or her fellow employees. Any employee who is laid off or discharged in violation of this section or is otherwise not paid because he or she refused to perform work in the performance of which this code, any occupational safety or health standard or any safety order of the division or standards board will be violated and where the violation would create a real and apparent hazard to the employee or his or her fellow employees shall have a right of action for wages for the time the employee is without work as a result of the layoff or discharge.”

Moreover, be advised that *Labor Code Section 132a* strictly prohibits an employer’s “discrimination against workers who are injured in the course and scope of their employment.” Also, *Labor Code Section 4553* provides in pertinent part, “The amount of compensation otherwise recoverable shall be increased one-half…where employee is injured by reason of the serious and willful misconduct…of…[t]he employer…” And *Labor Code Section 3202* imposes a policy of liberal construction in favor of protecting persons injured in the course of their employment.

The prompt payment of wages due an employee is a fundamental public policy of California. *Gould v. Maryland Sound Industries, Inc. (1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 1137, 1147*. “[Because] of the economic position of the average worker and, in particular, his dependence on wages for the necessities of life for himself and his family, it is essential to the public welfare that he receive his pay’ promptly.” *Pressler v. Donald L. Bren Co. (1982) 32 Cal.3d 831, 837*.

Further, California’s Healthy Workplaces, Healthy Families Act of 2014 and Kin Care Law prohibit employers from denying or in any manner discriminating against an employee for using or attempting to exercise the right to use accrued sick days to attend to employee’s or a family member’s illness.

In this case, Acme Manufacturing Co terminated Wiley Coyote in explicit violation of California law and public policy. Wiley Coyote was terminated after reporting theft and insubordination, which could be considered retaliation and wrongful termination in violation of public policy. On or about December 8, 2023, Wiley reported theft at work to HR because his subordinate, Homer Simpson, unplugged the time clock and was falsifying his time during breaks. HR did nothing. On November 1, 2023, Wiley had reported the same subordinate for insubordination to HR and to his supervisor, Bugs Bunny, and the employer took no actions or reprimanded the subordinate. Wiley made oral reports and has text messages detailing the reports for insubordination. Subsequently, Wiley was terminated after a 2-3 day suspension. Wiley was suspended because on his day off, a few co-workers and individuals that he supervised failed to show up for work without informing him. The email states that Wiley “failed to adequately prepare staff” and failed to communicate properly, basically causing a no call no show.

Thus, Acme Manufacturing Co terminated Wiley Coyote in explicit violation of California law and public policy. The remedies for wrongful termination include reinstatement with back pay and benefits, actual damages, front pay, punitive damages and a $10,000.00 civil penalty. *See Cal. Lab. Code §§ 1105, 1102.5(f); Barton v. New United Motor Mfg., Inc. (1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 1200, 1205; Freund v. Nycomed Amersham (9th Cir. 2003) 347 F3d 752, 758-760*. Wrongfully terminated workers can recover attorneys’ fees and costs. *See Cal. Gov. Code § 12965(b)*. Our client’s wrongful termination constitutes an adverse employment action and a wrongful termination in violation of public policy. *See Gantt v. Sentry Ins. (1992) 1 Cal.4th 1083, 1090-1091*. This conduct caused financial hardship. Our client has difficulty in procuring employment since the wrongful termination. Based on a regular hourly rate of $28.70 per hour, and the facts as set forth above, we conservatively calculate $89,460 in back pay that is owed. Our client is also entitled to front pay, which includes future earnings that begin to accrue after trial. Front pay may be awarded whenever reinstatement is not an option when the antagonism between employee and employer is such that it would be inappropriate to expect an employee to return to work. *See Kucia v. Southeast Ark. Community Action Corp. (8th Cir. 2002) 284 F3d 944, 948*. Reinstatement is untenable here, because of the hostile environment that our client would face on returning. Thus, our experts will testify to a monetary equivalent of reinstatement of approximately $120,000. Therefore, we will be seeking a minimum of **$209,460** as backpay and front pay, exclusive of punitive damages, attorney’s fees and costs associated with this claim for wrongful termination in violation of public policy.

<ins> **Meal Period and Rest Break Violations** </ins>

California law requires employers to provide employees with an uninterrupted, thirty (30) minute meal period each time they work more than five (5) hours in a day, and a second, uninterrupted thirty (30) minute meal period for employees who work more than ten (10) hours in a day. *See Cal. Lab. Code § 226.7, 512; California Code of Regulations, Title 8, §11040(11)*. The first meal period must be provided no later than the end of an employee’s fifth hour of work, and the second meal period by the end of the tenth hour. *See Cal. Lab. Code §512*. Employers are required to keep records of all meal periods taken. *California Code of Regulations, Title 8, §11040(7)(A)(3)*. Where an employer fails to record meal periods, there is a presumption that meal periods were not adequately provided. *See Brinker Restaurants Corp. v. Superior Court (2012) 53 Cal.4th 1004, 1052-1054*.

Rest periods are to be permitted in the middle of the shift “insofar as practicable.” *See 8 CCR § 11010-11150, Paragraph 12(A)*. The authorized rest period time shall be based on the total hours worked daily at the rate of ten (10) minutes net rest time per four (4) hours or major fraction thereof. Employers have an affirmative duty to ensure that workers are actually relieved of duty during rest breaks. *Cicairos v. Summit Logistics, Inc. (2005) 133 CA4th 949, 962-963*. An employer who fails to provide a required meal period or rest break must pay the employee one additional hour of pay at the employee’s regular rate of pay for each day a meal period and/or a rest break was not provided. *Labor Code § 226.7(c); 8 CCR §§ 11010-11150, Paragraph 11(D) and § 11160, Paragraph 10(F)*.

Most significantly, on May 23, 2022, the California Supreme Court’s decision in *Naranjo v. Spectrum Security Services, Inc.*, reaffirmed that meal and rest period premiums are “wages” under California law. *Naranjo v. Spectrum Security Services, Inc., (2022) 13 Cal.5th 93*.

In this case, Wiley Coyote suffered noncompliant meal and rest breaks because of the workload, understaffing, and company practice. Specifically, he was required to prioritize work over his breaks. Consequently, his meal and rest breaks were regularly late, missed, and/or interrupted. Thus, Acme Manufacturing Co deterred and discouraged Wiley Coyote from taking compliant meal and rest periods it knew or reasonably should have known about.

Wiley Coyote missed meal breaks 4 times a week and rest breaks twice a week due to supervising tasks, which is a violation of California labor laws. Therefore, based on Wiley Coyote’s hourly rate of $28.70 and the number of violations, he is owed **$17,220.00** in meal and rest premium pay. This amount is calculated as follows:

$28.70/hr. x (4 meal break premiums + 2 rest break premiums) x 72 weeks = $17,220.00

Wiley Coyote worked from July 27, 2020, to December 18, 2021, which spans approximately 72 weeks. During this period, he missed 4 meal breaks and 2 rest breaks each week, leading to a total of 6 violations per week. Thus, the total premium pay owed to Wiley Coyote is **$17,220.00**.

<ins> **Whistleblower Violation** </ins>

Per *Labor Code section 1102.5(a)*, an employer, or any person acting on behalf of the employer, shall not make, adopt, or enforce any rule, regulation, or policy preventing an employee from disclosing information to a person with authority over the employee, or to another employee who has authority to investigate, discover, or correct the violation or noncompliance, or from providing information to, or testifying before, any public body conducting an investigation, hearing, or inquiry, if the employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses a violation of state or federal statute, or a violation of or noncompliance with a local, state, or federal rule or regulation, regardless of whether disclosing the information is part of the employee’s job duties. Once an employee-whistleblower establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that retaliation was a contributing factor in the employee's termination, demotion, or other adverse action, the employer then bears the burden of demonstrating by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same action for legitimate, independent reasons. *Lawson v. PPG Architectural Finishes, Inc. (2022) 12 Cal.5th 703, 707*. An employer, or any person acting on behalf of the employer, shall not retaliate against an employee for disclosing information, or because the employer believes that the employee disclosed or may disclose information to a person with authority over the employee or another employee who has the authority to investigate, discover, or correct the violation or noncompliance, or for providing information to, or testifying before, any public body conducting an investigation, hearing, or inquiry, if the employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses a violation of state or federal statute, or a violation of or noncompliance with a local, state, or federal rule or regulation, regardless of whether disclosing the information is part of the employee’s job duties. *Id. at (b)*. Also, an employer, or any person acting on behalf of the employer, shall not retaliate against an employee for refusing to participate in an activity that would result in a violation of state or federal statute, or a violation of or noncompliance with a local, state, or federal rule or regulation. *Id. at (c)*. An employer that is a corporation or limited liability company is liable for a civil penalty not exceeding ten thousand dollars ($10,000) for each violation of this section. *Id. at (d) and (f)*. Further, a section 1102.5(c) violation triggers civil penalties pursuant to PAGA. *See Cal. Lab. Code § 2699.5*.

In this specific case, Wiley Coyote, a supervisor at Acme Manufacturing Co, reported theft and insubordination by his subordinate, Homer Simpson. On or about December 8, 2023, Wiley reported to HR that Homer had unplugged the time clock and falsified his time during breaks. Despite this, HR took no action. Additionally, on November 1, 2023, Wiley had reported the same subordinate for insubordination to both HR and his supervisor, Bugs Bunny, but again, no action was taken.

Following these reports, Wiley faced retaliatory actions, including suspension and eventual termination. Wiley was suspended because, on his day off, several co-workers and individuals he supervised failed to show up for work without informing him. The email from his employer stated that Wiley "failed to adequately prepare staff" and failed to communicate properly, which allegedly caused a no-call no-show situation. Subsequently, Wiley was terminated after a 2-3 day suspension.

Given these circumstances, it is evident that Wiley's termination was a direct result of his whistleblowing activities. Wiley has text messages detailing his reports of insubordination, which serve as evidence of his claims. Under *Labor Code section 1102.5(a)*, Wiley's employer, Acme Manufacturing Co, is prohibited from retaliating against him for disclosing information about violations or noncompliance with local, state, or federal rules or regulations.

Therefore, Wiley Coyote has a legitimate claim for whistleblower retaliation under *Labor Code section 1102.5(a)*. Acme Manufacturing Co's actions in terminating Wiley after his reports of theft and insubordination constitute a clear violation of this statute. As a result, Wiley is entitled to seek remedies for the retaliation he faced, including potential civil penalties against his employer.

<ins>Attorney Fees and Costs</ins>

The claims set forth here also give rise to an award of attorneys’ fees and costs for FEHA and wage-and-hour violations. *See Cal. Govt. Code § 12965(b); Cal. Labor Code §§ 218.5, 226(h), 1194.* This firm has already expended numerous hours communicating with Wiley Coyote and evaluating these various causes of action by reviewing documents he has provided and conducting related research and investigation. The time expended and corresponding fees will only increase if this dispute continues into litigation. Similar cases taken to trial have resulted in awards of fees and expenses in six figures. This of course does not include the fees and other expenditures spent in defending the lawsuit.

<ins>Class Action, FLSA Collective Action, and PAGA Exposure</ins>

The violations that Wiley Coyote experienced also appear to have been systematic in nature. As such, our firm is conferring with Wiley Coyote about bringing a class action, a collective action under the Fair Labor Standards Act (*FLSA*), or a representative action under the Labor Code Private Attorney General Act (*“PAGA,”*) which could result in civil penalty liability, aggregate liability, or both. While it will require considerable discovery, including depositions and document subpoenas, to determine the depth and scope of these violations, such cases typically give rise to hundreds of thousands of dollars in exposure and result in significant legal fees and costs. If we cannot resolve this matter on an individual basis, therefore, we will advise Wiley Coyote to move forward with not only individual claims, but also any available class, collective or representative claims as well. As you are aware, it is now settled law that, absent a binding arbitration agreement which specifically provides for same; there can be no waiver of the ability to bring PAGA claims. *See Iskanian v. CLS Transp., 59 Cal. 4th 348 (2014).* Thus, while we seek only an individual resolution right now, if Wiley Coyote cannot obtain a reasonable settlement, we will consider bringing a representative PAGA action to recover civil penalties on the State’s behalf. The California Court of Appeal recently certified for publication its decision in *Huff v. Securitas Security Services USA, Inc.* (Sixth Appellate District, No. H042852), holding affirmatively that: *PAGA allows an “aggrieved employee” ––a person affected by at least one Labor Code violation committed by an employer––to pursue penalties for all the Labor Code violations committed by that employer.* (Emphasis added.) There are thousands of labor rules and regulations that will be evaluated in a full audit, and Wiley Coyote will seek to be deputized by the state under PAGA to bring Acme Manufacturing Co into compliance and seek civil penalties therewith.

<ins>Individual Liability</ins>

If we cannot negotiate resolution of this matter, we will also name as defendants any individual deemed an “employer” attaching personal liability for the violations described above. *See Cal. Lab. Code § 558, 558.1 (“Any employer or other person acting on behalf of an employer who violates, or causes to be violated, a section of this chapter . . . shall be subject to a civil penalty”); accord Martinez v. Combs (2010) 49 Cal. 4th 35, 64 (2010).* Further, under *Cal. Govt Code § 12940(j)(3)*, supervisors are liable for harassing conduct. Our hope, however, is to avoid the time and expense of multiple-defendant litigation, including separate counsel to avoid conflicts of interest and the substantial expansion of discovery pertaining to each individual defendant under either the California or FLSA definition of “employer.”

<ins>Summary of Exposure</ins>

As set forth above, Acme Manufacturing Co faces substantial liability for the various enumerated claims and conduct described above. We have conservatively calculated the amount of that liability at more than **$226,680.00** per the damages calculated above including attorney’s fees and costs. This does not include the considerable time and energy of the parties, court costs (or should this dispute be arbitrated, the arbitrator’s fees and costs), and defense counsel’s fees and costs.

<ins>Settlement Demand</ins>

Our goal is to arrive at a fair and reasonable resolution to this dispute with as little time, energy and cost expended by the parties as possible. In our experience, a settlement can often be achieved for less than the expected cost of defense. To this end, our client is willing to settle all claims at this time for a total of **$226,680.00**. This demand is made in an effort to resolve the matter efficiently and in good faith. With this letter, I have also enclosed a draft settlement agreement for your consideration. Please note should the matter not settle and proceed to litigation and/or arbitration, any and all pre-litigation demands will be immediately withdrawn as our client pursues all available rights and remedies.
This settlement offer will remain open until close of business ten (10) calendar days from the date of this letter. If you do not respond to this letter, we will be forced to proceed accordingly.

Please contact me to discuss this matter further. My direct dial is (302 306-5750) telephone (direct) and my email address is jhaus@lfecr.com.
